## My solution to the below Frontend Mentor challenge

For my solution I've used Semantic HTML, CSS3 and vanilla JS.

CSS Grids and Flexbox in combination with media queries were used for the responsive layout.

On mobile screens the testimonials section turns into a carousel. This was achieved using `flex: 0 0 100%;` in CSS to make one testimonial dominate the screen and then adding a javascript onClick event listener to navigate between testimonials.
